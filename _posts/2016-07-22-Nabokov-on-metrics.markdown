This may be be a matter of course to people well versed in metrics. For my part, however, reading Nabokov’s “Appendix on Prosody” in his commentary on Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin was a major revelation.

Here is how Nabokov defines a scud:

> We speak of an “accent” in relation to a word and of a “stress” in relation to a metrical foot. A “scud” is an unaccented stress. “An inextínguishable fláme” has two accented and two unaccented stresses. When in verse a weak monosyllabic word (i.e., one not accented in speech) or a weak syllable of a long word happens to coincide with the stressed part (ictus) of a foot, there results a modulation that I term a “scud.” If an accented syllable in speech be notated’, and a stress accent in verse _́ , then a scud is marked _ . The unstressed part of a foot is marked    ͜   (for which a “depression” is the best term). [V. Nabokov,Commentary on Eugene Onegin, Vol. III, “Appendix on Prosody”, p. 454]

 

And this is how it operates in poetry:

> In English theories of prosody scuds have been described as “weak places,” which is too vague and ambiguous for recurrent nomenclatorial use, and defined as “omitted stresses,” which is meaningless, since the metrical stress of a scudded foot is not “omitted,” but merely *not trodden upon by the unaccented syllable of the passing word*, which, however, is aware of the unused steppingstone it skims.

[V. Nabokov, Commentary on Eugene Onegin, Vol. III, “Appendix on Prosody”, p. 458]
